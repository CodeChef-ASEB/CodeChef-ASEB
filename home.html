          Welcome to the official website of CODECHEF ASEB, the premier student club at Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru 
          dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about programming and computer science. 
          Our club is run by a team of dedicated leads and executives who work tirelessly to organize workshops, 
          weekly contests, and seminars by experts to help students in the campus learn and grow in the field of computer science.
          
          At CODECHEF ASEB, we believe in promoting a culture of innovation, learning, and collaboration among students 
          who are passionate about programming. Our club is led by the President, Suhas Prabhu, who brings a wealth of experience 
          and knowledge to the club. He is supported by Harsh Kumar Singh, our treasurer, who ensures that our club runs smoothly and efficiently.

          Our two vice presidents, Srigiri Sruthi and Chandra Madhav, are also an integral part of our team, working tirelessly to organize events 
          and workshops that help students build their skills and prepare for the future.

          We welcome all students who are interested in programming and computer science to join our community 
          and take advantage of the many resources and opportunities that CODECHEF ASEB has to offer. 
          Thank you for visiting our website, and we look forward to seeing you at our next event!
